## Background: What Is a Vector?

As you hopefully know from school, a **vector** is a quantity that has both **magnitude** (length) and **direction**. If not, I will give you a whistlestop tour, or you can read an introductory article [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html).

In 2D space, we have multiple ways to notate vectors. The main one I will use is **column notation**, which shows a vector as:
fv
![\mathbf v = \begin{bmatrix} x \ y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/Vector_definition.png)

Another common way to represent vectors is using **unit vectors and components**.

### Unit Vectors

**Unit** vectors are vectors that have a magnitude of 1 in a specific direction. For example:

![\hat x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \ 0 \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/hat_definition.png)

You will often see unit vectors denoted with a hat symbol (^) above the vector name.  
Additionally, you may see the unit vector for the x direction written as ![\hat i](/images/equations/general/i_hat.png) and for the y direction as ![\hat j](/images/equations/general/j_hat.png).

Therefore, to express a vector with x-component 3 and y-component 4 using unit vectors, we can write:

![\mathbf v = 3 \hat i + 4 \hat j](/images/equations/vec2/vector_with_unit_vectors.png)

### Magnitude

![Diagram showing vector magnitude](/images/vectordecomp.webp)

**Magnitude** (or length) of a vector is the distance from the origin to the point defined by the vector. As you should see from the diagram above, it is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

![|\mathbf v| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}](/images/equations/vec2/magnitude_definition.png)

The notation for a vector ![v](/images/equations/general/v.png)'s magnitude is ![|\mathbf v|](/images/equations/general/abs_v.png).

### Vector Addition and Subtraction

Vectors can be added and subtracted component-wise. For example, given two vectors:

![\mathbf a = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \ a_y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/vector_a_definition.png)

![\mathbf b = \begin{bmatrix} b_x \ b_y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/vector_b_definition.png)

The addition and subtraction of these vectors is defined as:

![\mathbf a + \mathbf b = \begin{bmatrix} a_x + b_x \ a_y + b_y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/vector_addition.png)

![\mathbf a - \mathbf b = \begin{bmatrix} a_x - b_x \ a_y - b_y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/vector_subtraction.png)

### Scalar Multiplication and Division

Vectors can be multiplied or divided by a scalar (a single number) by multiplying or dividing each component of the vector by that scalar. For example, given a vector:

![\mathbf a = \begin{bmatrix} x \ y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/vector_a_definition.png)

The scalar multiplication and division of this vector by a scalar \`k\` is defined as:

![k \times \mathbf a = \begin{bmatrix} k \times x \ k \times y \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/scalar_multiplication.png)

![\frac{\mathbf a}{k} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{x}{k} \ \frac{y}{k} \ \end{bmatrix}](/images/equations/vec2/scalar_division.png)

### The Dot Product

The dot product is a method for multiplying 2 vectors, it is notated mathematically as follows:

![\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b](/images/equations/vec2/adotb.png)

There are 2 methods to calculate the dot product.

The first method:

![\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = |\mathbf a | \times |\mathbf b| \times cos(\theta)](/images/equations/vec2/dot_product_1.png)

![|\mathbf a | \, is \, the \, magnitude \, of  \, \mathbf a \](/images/equations/vec2/dot_product_1_1.png)  
![|\mathbf b | \, is \, the \, magnitude \, of  \, \mathbf b \](/images/equations/vec2/dot_product_1_2.png)  
![\theta \, is \, the \, angle \, between \, \mathbf a \, and \, \mathbf b](/images/equations/vec2/dot_product_1_3.png)

The second method:

![\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = (\mathbf a_x \times \mathbf b_x) + (\mathbf a_y \times \mathbf b_y)](/images/equations/vec2/dot_product_2.png)

Where ![\mathbf a_x](/images/equations/general/a_x.png) and ![\mathbf a_y](/images/equations/general/a_y.png) are the x and y components of vector **a** respectively, and the same applies to vector **b**.

Vectors are foundational in:

- Geometry (lines, points, and normals)  
- Physics (velocity, force, acceleration and pretty much everything else!)  
- Computer graphics (movement, transformations)  
- Game development (positions, rotations, collision detection)  

Let us now take our first step towards creating a 2D vector struct in Rust!

---

## Task 1: Defining a 2D Vector Type

First off, we need to create a Rust struct called \`Vec2\` to represent a 2D vector.

- It should contain \`(x, y)\` variables  
- You should [derive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/derive.html) common traits such as \`Clone\`, \`Copy\`, \`Debug\`, \`PartialEq\` and \`Constructor\`  
- Finally, you should define a few useful common constant vectors such as \`ZERO\`, \`ONE\` and **unit** vectors for the x and y directions.

This sets the foundation for all vector operations.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Constructor)]
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
}

impl Vec2 {
    pub const ZERO: Vec2 = Vec2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
    pub const ONE: Vec2 = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 1.0 };
    pub const UNIT_X: Vec2 = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 0.0 };
    pub const UNIT_Y: Vec2 = Vec2 { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 };
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 2: Computing Magnitude (Vector Length)

Using the Pythagorean theorem, implement a method on \`Vec2\` to compute the magnitude (length) of the vector.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
impl Vec2 {
    pub fn mag(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y).sqrt()
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 3: Vector Arithmetic

Using Rust's operator overloading capabilities, implement addition and subtraction for \`Vec2\` so that you can add and subtract vectors using the \`+\` and \`-\` operators.

I would recommend using the [\`derive_more\`](https://crates.io/crates/derive_more) crate to make this easier.

### Solution (using derive_more for operator overloading)

\`\`\`rust
use derive_more::{Add, Sub};

#[derive(Add, Sub, Div, Mul, Neg, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Constructor)]
// The same as Task 1 but with Add and Sub traits
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
}
\`\`\`

### Solution (manually implementing Add and Sub traits)

\`\`\`rust
impl std::ops::Add for Vec2 {
    type Output = Vec2;

    fn add(self, other: Vec2) -> Vec2 {
        Vec2 {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

impl std::ops::Sub for Vec2 {
    type Output = Vec2;

    fn sub(self, other: Vec2) -> Vec2 {
        Vec2 {
            x: self.x - other.x,
            y: self.y - other.y,
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 4: The Dot Product

Implement a method on \`Vec2\` to compute the dot product between two vectors as we defined earlier.  
I recommend implementing this as a method called \`dot\` that takes \`&self\` and another \`Vec2\` as an argument and returns an \`f64\`.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
impl Vec2 {
    pub fn dot(&self, other: &Vec2) -> f64 {
        (self.x * other.x) + (self.y * other.y)
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 5: Component Mapping

Implement a method on \`Vec2\` called \`map\` that takes a closure as an argument. This closure should take a single \`f64\` and return a \`f64\`. The \`map\` method should apply this closure to both the x and y components of the vector and return a new \`Vec2\` with the results.

Mathematically speaking, we are applying a function \`f\` to each component of the vector.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
impl Vec2 {
    pub fn map<F>(&self, f: F) -> Vec2
    where
        F: Fn(f64) -> f64,
    {
        let fx = f(self.x);
        let fy = f(self.y);
        Vec2 { x: fx, y: fy }
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 6: Normalizing a Vector

Normalizing a vector means scaling it to have a magnitude of 1 while maintaining its direction. Implement a method on \`Vec2\` called \`normalize\` that returns a new \`Vec2\` that is the normalized version of the original vector.

The \`map\` function from Task 5 may be useful here.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
impl Vec2 {
    pub fn normalize(&self) -> Vec2 {
        let m = self.mag();
        if m == 0.0 {
            return Vec2::ZERO; // or handle zero-length vector case as needed
        }
        self.map(|i| i / m)
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 7: Scalar Multiplication and Division

Implement scalar multiplication and division for \`Vec2\` so that you can multiply and divide a vector by a scalar using the \`*\` and \`/\` operators.  
You can use the [\`derive_more\`](https://crates.io/crates/derive_more) crate again to make this easier.

### Solution (using derive_more for operator overloading)

\`\`\`rust
use derive_more::{Mul, Div, Add, Sub};

#[derive(Add, Sub, Div, Mul, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Constructor)]
// The same as Task 1 and 3 but with Mul and Div traits
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
}
\`\`\`

### Solution (manually implementing Mul and Div traits)

\`\`\`rust
impl std::ops::Mul<f64> for Vec2 {
    type Output = Vec2;

    fn mul(self, scalar: f64) -> Vec2 {
        Vec2 {
            x: self.x * scalar,
            y: self.y * scalar,
        }
    }
}

impl std::ops::Div<f64> for Vec2 {
    type Output = Vec2;

    fn div(self, scalar: f64) -> Vec2 {
        Vec2 {
            x: self.x / scalar,
            y: self.y / scalar,
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 8: Using Vec2 as a Point

In many applications, 2D vectors are used to represent points in space. We should implement a method on \`Vec2\` called \`dist\` that takes another \`Vec2\` as an argument and returns the distance between the two points represented by the vectors.

Perhaps we could also add an alias type for \`Point2D\` that is just a \`Vec2\` to make the intent clearer when using it as a point.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
pub type Point2D = Vec2;

impl Vec2 {
    pub fn dist(&self, other: &Point2D) -> f64 {
        (*self - *other).mag().abs()
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Task 9: Testing and Validation

Write [unit tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/unit_testing.html) for all the methods and operator overloads you have implemented for \`Vec2\`. Ensure that your tests cover various cases, including edge cases like zero-length vectors.

### Solution

\`\`\`rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        let v1 = Vec2::ZERO;
        let v2 = Vec2::ONE;
        assert_eq!(v1 + v2, Vec2::ONE);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_sub() {
        let v1 = Vec2::new(5.0, 7.0);
        let v2 = Vec2::new(2.0, 3.0);
        assert_eq!(v1 - v2, Vec2::new(3.0, 4.0));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_mag() {
        let v = Vec2::new(3.0, 4.0);
        assert_eq!(v.mag(), 5.0);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_dot() {
        let a = Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0);
        let b = Vec2::new(3.0, 4.0);
        assert_eq!(a.dot(&b), 11.0);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_map() {
        let v = Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0);
        let mapped = v.map(|x| x * 2.0);
        assert_eq!(mapped, Vec2::new(2.0, 4.0));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_normalize() {
        let v = Vec2::new(3.0, 4.0);
        let n = v.normalize();
        assert!((n.mag() - 1.0).abs() < 1e-10);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_scalar_mul() {
        let v = Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0);
        assert_eq!(2.0 * v, Vec2::new(2.0, 4.0));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_scalar_div() {
        let v = Vec2::new(2.0, 4.0);
        assert_eq!(v / 2.0, Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_dist() {
        let a = Point2D::new(1.0, 2.0);
        let b = Point2D::new(1.0, 0.0);
        assert_eq!(a.dist(&b), 2.0);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_zero_length_normalize() {
        let v = Vec2::ZERO;
        let n = v.normalize();
        assert_eq!(n, Vec2::ZERO); // or however you choose to handle this case
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_dot_perpendicular() {
        let a = Vec2::UNIT_X;
        let b = Vec2::UNIT_Y;
        assert_eq!(a.dot(&b), 0.0);
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a basic 2D vector type in Rust with essential operations and tests. This \`Vec2\` struct can now serve as a foundation for more complex mathematical operations and applications in graphics, physics, and game development.

As next steps, consider exploring:

- Implementing additional vector operations such as the 2D cross product, angle between vectors, and projection.  
- Extending the \`Vec2\` struct to support more advanced features like interpolation (lerp).  

In the next part of this series, we will build upon this foundation to create a 3D vector type, improve our 2D vector slightly and explore more complex mathematical concepts.

The code and ideas for this series is based on my **lars** math crate, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/JCooper-Bit/lars).
